	<h2>About Us</h2>

	<p>The Ely Watercolor Club was founded in 1985 by local artists in Ely Minnesota.</p>

	<p>
		We are a group of independent artists who primarily focus on watercolor painting. We have weekly
		painting sessions at a local church and we have our annual show and sale every summer.
	</p>

	<p>
		Many of us also participate in other local artist groups and our art can be found around town in
		many businesses and at <a href="https://elysartandsoul.com/" target="_blank"
			>Art & Soul Gallery</a
		>.
